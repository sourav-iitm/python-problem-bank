# Problems

I added these questions because either I found the question good or I found a pretty clever solution in the submissions.

## 4 kyu 

### 1. **Next bigger number with the same digits**

Create a function that takes a positive integer and returns the next bigger number that can be formed by rearranging its digits. For example:

  12 ==> 21
 513 ==> 531
2017 ==> 2071

If the digits can't be rearranged to form a bigger number, return -1 (or nil in Swift, None in Rust):

  9 ==> -1
111 ==> -1
531 ==> -1

### 2. **Next smaller number with the same digits**

(Similar to problem 1, just inversed)
Write a function that takes a positive integer and returns the next smaller positive integer containing the same digits.

For example:

next_smaller(21) == 12
next_smaller(531) == 513
next_smaller(2071) == 2017

Return -1 (for Haskell: return Nothing, for Rust: return None), when there is no smaller number that contains the same digits. Also return -1 when the next smaller number with the same digits would require the leading digit to be zero.

next_smaller(9) == -1
next_smaller(135) == -1
next_smaller(1027) == -1  # 0721 is out since we don't write numbers with leading zeros

    some tests will include very large numbers.
    test data only employs positive integers.

The function you write for this challenge is the inverse of this kata: "Next bigger number with the same digits."

### 1. **Your order, please**

Description:

Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result.

Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).

If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.
Examples

"is2 Thi1s T4est 3a"  -->  "Thi1s is2 3a T4est"
"4of Fo1r pe6ople g3ood th5e the2"  -->  "Fo1r the2 g3ood 4of th5e pe6ople"
""  -->  ""

### 2. **Find the odd int**

Description:

Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.
Examples

[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).
